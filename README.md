# Project Overview

This is a project that I began over lockdown. It is a mod for a game called Terraria and was my first experience creating a project without guidance. I had never used C# before and had only used a limited amount of python and html before mostly through school and a few online challenges. This project was so special because I was incredibly dedicated and passionate which lead me to put in lots of time and effort to learning new skills. You can see so clearly the progress I made though GitHub and how much I learned along the way. Very quickly I understood the importance of creating scalable and maintainable code and this is something I now prioritise in my larger projects. I am most proud of how much effort I put into it which showed me that I could create anything that I wanted and I had big expectations by the end! Eventually it had grow to over 100,000 downloads and having a small team working with me as well as receiving a small amount of recognition in the community.
